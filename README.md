# Chrome Inspector Twilight Theme

This is just my implementation and is probably not 100% what you would expect. The way the Chrome inspector wraps things is different to how code editors do it, so it's not possible to get it _identical_, but we can get a close approximation.

As always, if you see something that you can improve on, please do so and send a pull request :)
