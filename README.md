# Chrome Inspector Twilight Theme

This is just my implementation and is probably not 100% what you would expect. The way the Chrome inspector wraps things is different to how code editors do it, so it's not possible to get it _identical_, but we can get a close approximation.

As always, if you see something that you can improve on, please do so and send a pull request :)

## Installation

[This post][installation] by [Darcy Clarke][darcy-clarke] should help you out.

## Known Issues

* The toolbar in the detached inspector isn't looking too hot right now.

## Credits

I based this file off of the [mnml Theme][mnml] [Michael P. Pfeiffer][michael-pfeiffer], which itself was based off of [the Tomorrow Theme][tomorrow] by [Ben Truyman][ben-truyman].
